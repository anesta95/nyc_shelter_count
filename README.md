# Daily DHS NYC Unhoused Data Update

This repository contains a collection of data files that track the number of people in shelters across New York City. The `dhs_unhoused_report.csv` file in the `data` folder is cleaned and tidy version of the [daily DHS report pdfs](https://www.nyc.gov/assets/dhs/downloads/pdf/dailyreport.pdf) on shelter usage statistics released by the NYC Department of Homeless Services.
This data includes the daily number of families and individuals residing in the Department of Homeless Services (DHS) shelter system and the daily number of families applying to the DHS shelter system. The file `dhs_daily_report_open_data_nyc_socrata.csv` in the data folder is a tidy version of most of the data from the DHS pdfs available on the [NYC open data portal site](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Social-Services/DHS-Homeless-Shelter-Census/3pjg-ncn9). The `ll37_data_unique_by_agency.csv` is a data file of the monthly shelter usage statistics reported every month under DHS Local Law 37 by the [Department of Homeless Services (DHS)](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Social-Services/Local-Law-37-DHS-Report/2mqz-v5im), [Department of Youth and Community Development (DYCD)](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Social-Services/Local-Law-37-DYCD-Report/2232-dj5q), [Department of Housing Preservation and Development (HPD)](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Housing-Development/Local-Law-37-HPD-Monthly-Shelter-Census-Report/mdht-5s6e), and [Human Resources Administration (HRA)](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Social-Services/Local-Law-37-HRA-Report/e4ty-r26d).
